      <h1>0.7</h1>
<h3>28th February, 2010</h3>
<ul>

<li>Various &quot;under the hood&quot; improvements and code cleanups.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.6.1</h1>
<h3>23rd August, 2009</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug (introduced in version 0.6) where the creation of new data
elements caused an error.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug (introduced in version 0.6) where compressed pixel data were no
longer detected correctly.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where writing a <a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> file
with no path prefix failed.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where creating a new data element in a <a
href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> file with tag hierarchies gave an
invalid <a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> file.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where retrieving a RMagick image from <a
href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> files containing two sets of image
data failed.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.6</h1>
<h3>13th August, 2009</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete rewrite of encoding/decoding to reduce code duplication and
simplify the code.

</li>
<li>General optimizations to improve speed and reduce code complexity.

</li>
<li>Rewrote Dictionary to use Hash instead of <a
href="../classes/Array.html">Array</a>. This has significantly improved the
read spead of the library.

away trailing whitespace when decoding string values.

</li>
<li>Introducing basic, experimental network functionality.

server (Service Class Provider).

</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.5</h1>
<h3>4th May, 2009</h3>
<ul>
<li>Several small changes have been made to achieve compatibility with both
Ruby versions 1.8 and 1.9.

</li>
<li>Implemented a change in syntax for several methods with a goal of
simplification.

</li>
<li>Implemented a change in syntax for some methods, variables and messages in
order to better match the terminology used in the official <a
href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> documents.

</li>
<li>Added a new attr_reader :errors, an array that holds any warnings issued
during your interaction with DObject.

</li>
<li>DObject has received new attr_readers for the arrays holding information on
the <a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> object. See documentation for
details.

</li>
<li>Several methods have been cleaned up, making execution in some cases
somewhat snappier.

</li>
<li>Several methods have been made more robust.

</li>
<li>Added new option :partial to the get_pos() method, which will enable search
for partial string matches.

</li>
<li>Added new option :array to the get_value() and get_raw() methods which
enables easy extraction of multiple values of a given tag to an array
(relevant for tags present at multiple places in a <a
href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> file).

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where exception folders where ignored in the Anonymizer class.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.4</h1>
<h3>3rd February, 2009</h3>
<ul>
<li>Change of syntax: Options are now supplied as hash.

</li>
<li>Method below() renamed to children().

</li>
<li>Added method parents() which returns the position of all items/sequences
that are the parent of the specified tag. This method is only relevant for
<a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> tags that exist inside a
hierarchy.

</li>
<li>Simplified the code in class Dictionary: load time is ~ 40 times faster!

</li>
<li>Improved the code in class DRead: average read time is reduced by ~ 15 %.

</li>
<li>Improved support for Big Endian <a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a>
files.

</li>
<li>Added support for the &quot;FL&quot; (floating point single) value
representation.

</li>
<li>Fixed a small bug with tag 0028,3006 in Dictionary.

</li>
<li>New method image_to_file() which makes it even easier than before to dump
the <a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> pixel data to file.

</li>
<li>Introducing DWrite class which enables writing <a
href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> objects to file.

</li>
<li>Added several methods in DObject class to take advantage of write
capability: remove_tag() set_value() set_image_magick() set_image_file()
write_file()

</li>
<li>Introducing the Anonymizer class, which takes advantage of the new write
capability in Ruby <a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> to offer a
fairly powerful and customizable tool for anonymizing your <a
href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> files.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.3</h1>
<h3>12th October, 2008</h3>
<ul>
<li>The DRead class is now able to keep track of the position of the tags
inside the hierarchy of sequences and items.

</li>
<li>DObject class has seen a number of improvements to allow taking advantage
of this hierarchy awareness:

</li>
<li>Method get_pos() now can take an array of positions as an argument when
searching for tags, meaning it will only search for hits amongst the
positions provided.

</li>
<li>Method print() has been improved with new options to visualize the tree
structure of the <a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> file.

</li>
<li>Method print() is able to print to file as well. The text file will be put
in the same folder as the <a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> file.

</li>
<li>New method below(), which lets you specify a sequence or item, and this
method will return the position of all tags contained in this
sequence/item.

</li>
<li>Method print_properties() have been updated to display more information
about the <a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> object.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.2</h1>
<h3>10th August, 2008</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data dictionary has been upgraded and is now compliant to the official
standard.

</li>
<li>New DLibrary class which handles all interaction with the dictionary.

</li>
<li>Dictionary can be loaded before reading files, which will considerably
speed up the process if reading multiple files.

</li>
<li>Reading compressed pixel data into an RMagick object is supported in
principle, although it lacks proper testing at this point.

</li>
<li>DRead class is more resistant to breaking if it is handed a faulty file to
read, and will return an error message instead of halting execution.

</li>
<li>Added option to load <a href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> object in
verbose or silent mode.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.1</h1>
<h3>20th July, 2008</h3>
<p>
First public release. The library does have several known issues and lacks
some features I would like it to have, but it does offer basic
functionality and should be usable for people interested in working with <a
href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> files in Ruby. The reading algorithm
has been tested succesfully with some 40 different <a
href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> files, so it should be fairly
robust.
</p>
<p>
Known issues:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The retrieve file network functionality (get_image() in DClient class) has
not been tested.

</li>
<li>Compressed pixel data is poorly handled.

</li>
<li>Read/Write 12 bit image data not available.

</li>
<li>Color image data is poorly handled.

</li>
<li>Incomplete support for Big endian (Everything but signed short and signed
long has been implemented).

</li>
<li>Incomplete support for multiple frame image data to NArray and RMagick
objects (partial support already featured).

</li>
<li>Image handling does not take into consideration <a
href="../classes/DICOM.html">DICOM</a> tags which specify orientation,
samples per pixel and photometric interpretation.

</li>
</ul>
