RUBY DICOM
======================

SUMMARY
--------

This is a fairly basic library for handling DICOM files in Ruby. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is a standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging. It includes a file format definition and a network communications protocol. Ruby DICOM supports reading from, editing and writing to this file format.

BASIC USAGE
-----------

require 'dicom'
# Read file:
dcm = DICOM::DObject.new("myFile.dcm")
# Display some key information about the file:
dcm.print_properties()
# Print all tags to screen:
dcm.print(true)
# Retrieve a data element value:
name = dcm.get_value("0010.0010")
# Retrieve pixel data:
pixels = dcm.get_value("7FE0.0010")
# Load pixel data to a RMagick object and display it on screen:
image = dcm.get_image_magick()
image[0].display
# Load pixel data to a NArray object and display it on screen:
image = dcm.get_image_narray()
NImage.show image[0,true,true]

Tip:
When playing around with Ruby DICOM in irb, you may be annoyed
with all the information that is printed to screen, regardless
if you have specified verbose as false. This is because in irb
every variable loaded in the program is automatically printed.
A hack to avoid this effect is to append ";0" after a command.
Example:
dcm = DICOM::DObject.new("myFile.dcm") ;0
