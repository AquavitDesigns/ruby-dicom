RUBY DICOM
======================

SUMMARY
--------

Ruby DICOM is a small and simple library for handling DICOM in Ruby. DICOM (Digital Imaging
and Communications in Medicine) is a standard for handling, storing, printing,
and transmitting information in medical imaging. It includes a file format definition
and a network communications protocol. Ruby DICOM supports reading from, editing
and writing to this file format. It also features basic support for select network
communication modalities like querying, moving, sending and receiving files.

BASIC USAGE
-----------

require "dicom"
# Read file:
dcm = DICOM::DObject.new("myFile.dcm")
# Display some key information about the file:
dcm.information
# Print all data elements to screen:
dcm.print
# Retrieve a data element value:
name = dcm.value("0010.0010")
# Remove a data element from the DICOM object:
dcm.remove("7FE0,0010")
# Retrieve pixel data to a Ruby Array:
pixels = dcm.get_image
# Load pixel data to a RMagick image object and display it on screen:
image = dcm.get_image_magick
image.display
# Load pixel data to a NArray object and display it on screen:
pixel_data = dcm.get_image_narray
NImage.show pixel_data[0,true,true]
# Send a local file to a server (PACS) over the network:
node = DICOM::DClient.new("10.1.25.200", 104)
node.send("myFile.dcm")

Tip:
When playing around with Ruby DICOM in irb, you may be annoyed with all the information
that is printed to screen, regardless if you have specified verbose as false. This is because
in irb every variable loaded in the program is automatically printed to the screen.
A useful hack to avoid this effect is to append ";0" after a command.
Example:
dcm = DICOM::DObject.new("myFile.dcm") ;0
